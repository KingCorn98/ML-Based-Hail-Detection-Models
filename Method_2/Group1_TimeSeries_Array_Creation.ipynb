The problem is we might get confused details if we normalize features values without taking into account possible time-differences thanks to global warming, as well as the idea that different latitudes and longitudes for those features might in turn have different population paramters for those features (ie: for a longer state like California you would expect the normal temperuature in the north to differ from that in the south of the state)\n","\n","We also have the problem that thanks to the sheer amount of data and normalization requiring that data be within in order to determine the sample mean and standard deviation to then normalize the data. Since this is difficult given the size of the data, some work around must be considered. For this, I have 3 ideas:\n","\n","#### Idea 1: No normalizaton.\n","This is admitidly a very risky proposition since we see that temperatures (which seem to be in Kelvin if a range of 199->300 can be explained) are vasily higher compared to humidity (0.0 to 0.013966 is very low indeed)\n","\n","#### Idea 2: Yearly Normalization\n","In order to desregard control for monthly changes and save room, we could instead open the data one at a time and create a running average of the mean and standard-deviation over the course of a single year for the oringinal data. Then we use this in a normalizaton one at a time.\n","\n","This would require running through the ERA-Files twice. Once to generate the population parameters for our normalization, then again in order to sort and create and normalize our array-data for time-series.\n","\n","**I will be doing this one for now, then might try idea 3 later on if needed.**\n","\n","##### Possible Alteration: Do per-month normalization, and apply the normalization at each month.\n","\n","\n","\n","#### Idea 3: Yearly-Local Normalizaton\n","An even more complex idea for normalization that takes into account local averages in these features differing across the state, it could do as above, but also take into account latitude/longitude range location, by making it be the average of the nearest local cells. So the top-corner-left cell would be normalized for the averages across it and the surrounding 3 cells, the next at the top for the surrounding 5, the one in the center for the surrounding 8 cells, ect. This process would be extremely difficult, and might lead to problems.\n","\n","However, it would control for local variations which we might not be able to see, as some areas might have less wind/humdity at certain altitudes thanks to mountains/valleys acting as buffer-zones. These might not factor into upper atmospheres however."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e8ab354a","metadata":{"id":"e8ab354a"},"source":["## Running through files over course of year to generate normalization parameters.\n","Each file will be opened, the atomosphereic levels will be combined with the four-features to create 37 x 4 = 148 features. Each will then have their mean, standard-deviance, and variance saved. After running through all the files, these running totals for each feature will be averaged. This assumes then that every year is normal than that overall these features do not change."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import

That Latitude goes down in its range means the range is of form [(42, 41.75], (41.75, 41.5], ..., (37.25, 37.0]]. This removal then is necessary in order to have fitted labels within another code file for these same ranges.\n","\n","#### Note: Reason for opening 2-files at a time.\n","The reason we open two files at a time, but shave off most of the instances by time-series is to make sure there aren't gaps in the pattern of [t-2, t-1, t, t+1, t+2] as by the nature of it, since we need the past 2 days to make predictions for the 3rd, we cannot predict for the first 2-days of the month. If this happens while opening a single file at a time, we end up with a 4-day gap via the last 2-days of the previous month the first 2-days of the next month.\n","\n","Opening two files at a time, and getting to the end of the last month with the time-series slide of days [26, 27, 28, 29, 30] then to get the 29th (2nd to last day of the month) then we need [27, 28, 29, 30, 1(next-month)], then to predict last day we need [28, 29, 30, 1, 2], and so on till to predict the 2nd day of the next month we need [30, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Then this collection of slides is saved before moving on. We close both files, then reopen with the 2nd month of the first subet, and the month after. So the pattern is [A, B], [B, C], [C, D], [D, E], ect. For the last iteration (november and december of 2022), do not throw out instances in december after 5th day and instead keep all of them. This ensures that we will have no gaps and only end up missing 4-days total: the first 2 days of the year 2010, and the last 2-days of the year 2022.\n","\n","#### Note: Correction, forget is by hour. Should instead by the first 4-hours or the first 65268 instances\n","\n","#### Note: This relies on for opening files A and B, B always being the next month. Thus it requires the data be stored in the directory in sequential month order, which may require specific naming convetions for the files to ensure this is happening. This process also depends on each ERA file being an entire month in a single year to prevent issues with days."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"a35704b9","metadata":{"id":"a35704b9","outputId":"bca41a6c-8733-4fc3-a55c-86e11dea9400"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["0
