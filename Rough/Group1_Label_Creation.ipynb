These records must be collected in parts as the website itself cannot display more than 500 at a time. After extracting data from the states of Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, and Kentucky, the individual files for each state where concatenated together in excel to create 5 record-files, one for each state, contained in the file **[Bulk_Weather_Events]**. This data was edited as the concatenation process and the poorness of the record keeping itself lead ot problems with the data itself, including severalfaulty instances or faulty comma-serpation for the original csv files. What records that were unsalvagable had to be removed, several others had to be edited by hand into their proper intended form.\n","\n","After this, the data was then edited to remove any instances where the date or time for both begining and end where not known. Where only one was unknown, in was turned into a short as possible instance event where the missing value for the begin/end date-time was filled in by the known begin/end date time. That is, if the end-time of a hail-event was known, but not the begining, then the begining was filled in with the end-value and considered a temporary 1-hour instance.\n","\n","After this, we then removed all instances which did not end after Jan 1, 2010 or began after December 31, 2022. We then removed any instances that did not begin nor end in the range of (37,42) Latitude and (-89,-84) Longitude. We then converted values which began or ended outside that boundry to begin/end at the closest boundry to ensure all instances where within the bounded study area.\n","\n","In extracting the datetime of the event, we round down to the nearest hour, so an event which began at 7:15 and went till 9:25 will instead have began at 7:00 and ended at 9:00. However, when stored, the event will include times (7=>8), (8=>9), and (9=>10). While this might lead to artificial inflating of the instances, it is close enough to consider safe for the dataset.\n","\n","## Next step\n","Once we have cleaned the data instances, we must make a blank 21 by 21 array for 113948 instances, one for each hour between the 2nd of Jan 1, 2010 to the 21st of December 31, 2022, including both ends of these hours. We then must convert the begin and end latitudes into a fitting of this range. Any which traveled a certain latitude will be considered having been a larger than average area during the entire start to end period, creating a rectangular-area of hail-events during that time-period. Any which began in one of the 21-latitude/longitude ranges and traveled into another will be considered a part of both ranges. So if a hail event began in Longitude -88.65 and ended in Longitude -88.45, then we will count in both in the cell representing range (-88.75 => -88.5) and (-88.5 => -88.25)."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","#drive.mount('/content/gdrive')\n","drive.mount('/content/gdrive',
